# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Projects

This repository contains two projects exploring the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification and customer segmentation tasks. KNN is a versatile and intuitive algorithm that can be applied in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings.

## Project 1: Numerical Feature-Based Classification with KNN

In this project, the goal was to classify data points based on a set of numerical features. The dataset used was intentionally unlabeled to highlight KNN's ability to work without domain knowledge.

**Code:** `KNN_Numerical_Classification.py`

## Project 2: Customer Segmentation with KNN on an Unlabeled Dataset

This project applied the KNN algorithm to a real-world marketing challenge: customer segmentation. By analyzing unlabeled data points, the aim was to discover hidden patterns and group customers based on their underlying behavior.
