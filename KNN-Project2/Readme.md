# KNN-Customer-Segmentation

This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to a real-world marketing challenge: customer segmentation. By analyzing unlabeled data points, the project aims to discover hidden patterns and group customers based on their underlying behavior.

## Key Highlights

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Utilizes KNN in an unsupervised setting where the dataset lacks explicit labels.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Demonstrates how KNN can identify distinct customer groups based on their similarities.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's accuracy with different 'K' values, achieving 84% accuracy on the test set.
- **Colab Notebook:** Provides a step-by-step guide to implementing and interpreting the KNN model in a Google Colab notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `KNN_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook cells to replicate the analysis.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

This project showcases the versatility of KNN for uncovering insights even when dealing with limited domain knowledge.
